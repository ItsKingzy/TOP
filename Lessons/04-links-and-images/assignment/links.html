        <h1>Links</h1>

        <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html" target="_self">images</a>.</p>

        <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

        <!-- Create an unordered list -->
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Relative links, like to our <a href="./misc/extras.html">extras page</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- We cannot explore the topics of root-relative paths because we dont have a server to host our website, but if we did we could also use this. -->
