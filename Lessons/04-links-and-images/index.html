        - THIS ANCHOR DOESNT WORK (i.e., its not a link) 
            - This is because we need ATTRIBUTES
                - An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML 
                element and always goes in the element’s OPENING tag
                - An attribute is usually made up of two parts: 
                    - a name, and a value
                - **Not all attributes have a value though
        -->


        <!-- href -->
        <!-- 
        - Short for "Hypertext reference"
        - We place href at the opening tag of an anchor statement
            - The value of the href attribute is the DESTINATION we want our link to go to
        - You can also use href for other hypertext links like images, videos, etc.

        <!-- MORE ATTRIBUTES -->
        <!-- 
        - target: specifies where the linked resource will be opened. 
            - If it is not present, then, BY DEFAULT, it will take on the "_self" value which opens the link in the current tab
        - rel: describe the relation between the current page and the linked document. The rel values are a list of space seperated link types between double quotes.
            - noopener: The value noopener ensures that a link opened in a new tab or window cannot interact with or access the original page (i.e., security)
                - Without it, the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which poses a security risk
            - noreferrer: provides both privacy and security. It prevents the new page from knowing where the user came from (hiding the referrer (i.e., privacy)) and also includes the behavior of noopener (i.e., security), preventing the new page from accessing the original page.

        <!-- Absolute and Relative Links -->
        <!-- 
        - Absolute Links: links to pages on other websites on the internet, which always includes the scheme and domain of the destination.
            - Defined as: scheme://domain/path
            - Ex: https://www.theodinproject.com/about
                - Scheme: https://
                - Domain: www.theodinproject.com
                - Path: /about
        
        - Relative Links: Links to other pages within our own website. They don't include the domain name since it's just another page associated with the same site (i.e., the domain is assumed to be the same).  
            - These links are essentially just file paths to other pages relative to the page you are currently on.
                Ex: Linking index.html to about.html
        -->
    
        <!-- EXAMPLE -->
        <h1>About Test</h1>
        <p><a href="./pages/about.html">About</a></p>
            <!-- This works because "index.html" and "about.html" are in the same directory -->
            <!-- We prepend "./" to start start of "pages/about.html" to avoid running into edge cases where the link may break if we cannot find the folder-->
        


        <!-- IMAGES -->

        <!-- 
        - <img>: Used to display images
            - This element is void type so it does not have a close tag (i.e., </img> does not exist)
                - A "void" element is an element that doesn't contain content like other tags might have (e.g., <p>Example</p>)
        - src: Short for source, this attribute tells the browser where the image is located, we can embed an image using absolute & relative paths (i.e., can be inside a directory or a link to an image on the web).
        -->

        <h2>Images WITHOUT "alt" attribute</h2>
        <!-- EXAMPLES -->
        <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png">
            <!-- This is an absolute link that referres to an image on the odin website -->
        
        <!-- DISPLAYING AN IMAGE USING A RELATIVE LINK -->
        <img src="./images/dog.jpg">
        
        <!-- DISPLAYING LICENSE INFO FOR IMAGES -->
        <img src="./images/imageLicenseInfo.png">



        <!-- Alt Attribute -->
        <!-- 
        alt: Short for "alternative text", Used to describe an image besides just having the link or path to the image
            - alt will be used in place of the image if the image cannot load.
            - Also useful for screen readers so they can describe the image for visually imparied users.
        -->
        
        <h2>Images WITH "alt" attribute</h2>

        <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo">
        <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="A Pug">



        <!-- IMAGE SIZING -->
        <!-- 
        using the attributes 'height' and 'width' within the <img> tag can be useful for:
            1. laying out the page to reduce jumping
            2. To specifiy actual dimensions for the image when using CSS later
            3. It's good practice

        ** Only defining either width or height makes your image scale proportionally, though, defining both makes your image scale in both directions
        -->
