        <!-- HTML Entities -->
        <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
        <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
        <!-- The <, >, and & characters are called “reserved characters” because they aren’t allowed to be inserted into an HTML document without being encoded. -->

        <!-- & is called "ampersand" -->
        <!-- 
        Entities always begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). 
            - amp: ampersand (&)
            - lt: less than (<)
            - gt: greater than (>)
        -->

        <!-- 
        Some more entities:
            - &ldquo; (left double quote)
            - &rdquo; (right double quote)
            - &lsquo; (left single quote)
            - &rsquo; (right single quote)
        -->
        <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
