        <h1>Variables and Operators</h1>

        <!-- This is how you include JS code inside HTML -->
        <script>
            // Your JavaScript goes here!
            console.log("Hello World!")
        </script>

        <ul>
            <li>"console.log()" is the command to print something to the developer console in your browser.</li>
            <li><img src="./img/JS-snippet.png"></li>
            <li>Another way to include JavaScript in a webpage is through an external script. This is very similar to linking external CSS docs to your website.</li>
            <ul><li>&lt;script&gt;src="javascript.js"&lt;/script&gt;</li></ul>
            <li>We named our file javascript.js inside the project folder but we could have chosen any name like my-script.js or even no name .js. What is really important is the .js extension.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can declare variables using the let keyword. Let's try it! (No pun intended). <em><strong>See Dev tools console</strong></em></li>
            <li>Here is the code we wrote (EX1):</li>
            <ul><li><img src="./img/JS-variables-1.png"></li></ul>
            <li>Here is the console output (EX1):</li>
            <ul><li><img src="./img/console-output-1.png"></li></ul>
            <li>Here is the code we wrote (EX2):</li>
            <ul><li><img src="./img/JS-variables-2.png"></li></ul>
            <li>Here is the console output (EX2):</li>
            <ul><li><img src="./img/console-output-2.png"></li></ul>
            <li>"<strong>const</strong>" is a <em>keyword</em> that assigned a fixed value to a variable that shall not be re-assigned</li>
            <li>Here is the code we wrote (EX3):</li>
            <ul><li><img src="./img/JS-variables-3.png"></li></ul>
            <li>Here is the console output (EX3):</li>
            <ul><li><img src="./img/console-output-3.png"></li></ul>
            <li>We I thought it was going to be 3.14, bu it's an error of <u>TypeError</u> (undefined behaviour).</li>
            <li>So in summary, there are two ways to declare a variable:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>let</strong>, which we can re-assign.</li>
                    <li><strong>const</strong> which we can’t re-assign and will throw an error if we try.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>There is also a third way, <strong>var</strong>, which was the original way variables were declared in JavaScript. var is similar to let in that variables assigned this way can be reassigned, but it has other quirks that were cleared up when the language introduced let and const. By and large, it is not used anymore. However, you will likely come across code which uses var at some point, so it is useful to know that it exists.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Example 1 -->
        <script>
            let firstName = "John";
            let lastName = "Doe";

            console.log(firstName);
            console.log(lastName);
        </script>

        <!-- Example 2 -->
        <script>
            let age = 11;
            console.log(age);

            age = 54;

            console.log(age);
        </script>

        <!-- Example 3 -->
        <script>
            const pi = 3.14;
            pi = 10;

            console.log(pi);
        </script>


        <h2>Numbers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>JS follows mathematical arithmetic convention: <strong>PEDMAS</strong></li>
            <li>Therefore, something like <strong>(3 + 2) - 76 * (1 + 1)</strong> is totally legal and valid in JS.</li>
        </ul>
