        <!-- Website 1: What is JS? -->
        <h2><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript">What is JavaScript?</a> Notes</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above).</li>
            <li>**When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>You might hear the terms <strong>interpreted</strong> and <strong>compiled</strong> in the context of programming.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interpreted languages</strong>, the code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned. You don't have to transform the code into a different form before the browser runs it. The code is received in its programmer-friendly text form and processed directly from that.</li>
                <li><strong>Compiled languages</strong> on the other hand are transformed (compiled) into another form before they are run by the computer. For example, C/C++ are compiled into machine code that is then run by the computer. The program is executed from a binary format, which was generated from the original program source code.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>**JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language.</li>
            <li>most modern JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called <strong>just-in-time compiling (JIT)</strong> to improve performance</li>
            <ul>
                <li>the JavaScript source code gets compiled into a faster, binary format while the script is being used</li>
                <li>However, JavaScript is still considered an interpreted language, since the compilation is handled at run time</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Client-side Code:</strong> code that is run on the user's computer — when a web page is viewed, the page's client-side code is downloaded, then run and displayed by the browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Server-side Code:</strong> run on the server, then its results are downloaded and displayed in the browser. Examples of popular server-side web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, and even JavaScript! JavaScript can also be used as a server-side language, for example in the popular Node.js environment.</li>
            <li>**Inline JS works aswell like CSS does!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ex: "&lt;button onclick="createParagraph()">Click me!&lt;/button>"</li>
                <li><strong>N.B.:</strong> This is bad practice, avoid doing at all costs</li>
            </ul>
            <li><img src="./img/script-loading-strats.png" width="500px"></li>
        </ul>
        <li>You can comment single line using // or multi line using /* .. .. .. */</li>

        <h2><a href="https://javascript.info/variables">Variables</a> Notes</h2>

        <ul>
            <li style="background-color: yellow">Refer to the examples in the index file to see JS <u>scripts</u> outputted in the console</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Example 1 -->
        <script>
            let message;
            message = "Hello! (From example 1 of variables)";

            // Uncomment the alert to see what it does
            //alert(message); // Shows the variable content
        </script>

        <!-- Example 2 -->
        <script>
            // We can do single line multiple declaration varibales
            let user = 'John', age = 25, message2 = 'Hello';

            // We could also just do single line declarations for clarity
            let user2 = 'John';
            let age2 = 25;
            let message22 = 'Hello';

            // Some people also define multiple variables in this multiline style:
            let user3 = 'John',
                age3 = 25,
                message3 = 'Hello';
            
            // Or even "comma-first" style (Dont do this, terrible readability)
            let user4 = 'John'
                , age4 = 25
                , message4 = 'Hello';
        </script>

        <!-- Example 3 -->
        <script>
            // In older scripts, you may also find another keyword: var instead of let:
            var message5 = 'Hello';
        </script>

        <!-- Exmaple 4 -->
        <script>
            // We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other.
            let hello6 = 'Hello world!';
            let message6;
            // copy 'Hello world' from hello into message
            message6 = hello6;
            // now two variables hold the same data
            //alert(hello6); // Hello world!
            //alert(message6); // Hello world!
        </script>

        <!-- Example 5 -->
        <script>
            //A variable should be declared only once. A repeated declaration of the same variable is an error:
            /*
            let message7 = "This";

            // repeated 'let' leads to an error
            let message7 = "That"; // SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared
            */
        </script>

        <ul>
            <li>There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.</li>
                <li>The first character must not be a digit.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <!-- Example 6 -->
        <script>
            // Both legal var names
            let userName;
            let test123;

            // Also legal
            let $ = 1;
            let _ = 2; 

            //alert($ + _);  // 3

            // Illegal use of vars
            //let 1a; // cannot start with a digit

            //let my-name; // hyphens '-' aren't allowed in the name
        </script>

        <!-- Example 7 -->
        <script>
            // Good practice to use uppercase constant var names
            const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
            const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
            const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
            const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";
        </script>

        <ul>
            <li>capital-named constants are only used as aliases for “hard-coded” values. lowercase are constants calculated at runtime.</li>
        </ul>
