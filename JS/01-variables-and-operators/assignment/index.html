        <!-- Website 1: What is JS? -->
        <h2><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript">What is JavaScript?</a> Notes</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above).</li>
            <li>**When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>You might hear the terms <strong>interpreted</strong> and <strong>compiled</strong> in the context of programming.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interpreted languages</strong>, the code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned. You don't have to transform the code into a different form before the browser runs it. The code is received in its programmer-friendly text form and processed directly from that.</li>
                <li><strong>Compiled languages</strong> on the other hand are transformed (compiled) into another form before they are run by the computer. For example, C/C++ are compiled into machine code that is then run by the computer. The program is executed from a binary format, which was generated from the original program source code.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>**JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language.</li>
            <li>most modern JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called <strong>just-in-time compiling (JIT)</strong> to improve performance</li>
            <ul>
                <li>the JavaScript source code gets compiled into a faster, binary format while the script is being used</li>
                <li>However, JavaScript is still considered an interpreted language, since the compilation is handled at run time</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Client-side Code:</strong> code that is run on the user's computer — when a web page is viewed, the page's client-side code is downloaded, then run and displayed by the browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Server-side Code:</strong> run on the server, then its results are downloaded and displayed in the browser. Examples of popular server-side web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, and even JavaScript! JavaScript can also be used as a server-side language, for example in the popular Node.js environment.</li>
            <li>**Inline JS works aswell like CSS does!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ex: "&lt;button onclick="createParagraph()">Click me!&lt;/button>"</li>
                <li><strong>N.B.:</strong> This is bad practice, avoid doing at all costs</li>
            </ul>
            <li><img src="./img/script-loading-strats.png" width="500px"></li>
        </ul>
        <li>You can comment single line using // or multi line using /* .. .. .. */</li>
