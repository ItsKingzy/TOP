        <ul>
            <li>A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above).</li>
            <li>**When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>You might hear the terms <strong>interpreted</strong> and <strong>compiled</strong> in the context of programming.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interpreted languages</strong>, the code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned. You don't have to transform the code into a different form before the browser runs it. The code is received in its programmer-friendly text form and processed directly from that.</li>
                <li><strong>Compiled languages</strong> on the other hand are transformed (compiled) into another form before they are run by the computer. For example, C/C++ are compiled into machine code that is then run by the computer. The program is executed from a binary format, which was generated from the original program source code.</li>
            </ul>
