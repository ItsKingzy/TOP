        <h1>Axes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Flexboxes work vertically (column) and horizontally (row)! </li>
            <li>The direction can be specified in CSS as follows:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="./img/flex-container.png" width="500px"></li>
            </ul>
            <li>No matter which direction you’re using, you need to think of your flex-containers as having 2 axes: the main axis and the cross axis. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>flex-direction: row puts the main axis horizontal (left-to-right)</li>
                <li>column puts the main axis vertical (top-to-bottom).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>"display: flex" on a div arranges its children horizontally. This is a demonstration of "flex-direction: row": the default setting.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Example flex-direction -->
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="one"></div>
            <div class="two"></div>
            <div class="three"></div>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>N.B.</strong><em>"flex-direction: column;" would not work for short hand "flex: 1" since "flex: 1;" &#8801; "flex: 1 1 0;", meaning the flex-basis is set to 0 so flex-grow and flex-shrink would begin their calculations from 0.</em></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Empty divs by default have 0 height, so for our flex items to fill up the height of their container, they don't actually need to have any height at all.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The example above fixed this by specifying flex: 1 1 auto, telling the flex items to default to their given height. We could also have fixed it by putting a height on the parent ".flex-container", or by using "flex-grow: 1;"</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>N.B., when we changed the flex-direction to column, flex-basis refers to height instead of width.</strong></li>
        </ul>
