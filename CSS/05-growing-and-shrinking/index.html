        <h1>Growing and Shrinking</h1>

        <!-- The flex shorthand -->
        <h2>The flex shorthand</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The "flex" declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can set on a flex item.</li>
            <li>These properties affect how flex items size themselves within their container.</li>
            <li><em>"Shorthand properties are CSS properties that let you set the values of multiple other CSS properties simultaneously."</em></li>
            <li>"flex" is shorthand for "flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis"</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ex:</strong>"flex: 1;" &#8801; "flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0"</li>
                <!--

            </ul>
        </ul>

        <!-- Flex-grow -->
        <h2>Flex-grow</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>flex-grow expects a <u>single number</u> as its value, and that number is used as the flex-item's “growth factor”.</li>
            <li>When we applied "flex: 1" to every div inside our container, we were telling every div to <u>grow the same amount</u>. The result of this is that every div ends up the exact same size.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If we instead add flex: 2 to just one of the divs, then that div would grow to 2x the size of the others.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <!-- Example flex-grow -->
        <h3>Example for flex-grow:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In the following example the "flex"shorthand has values for "flex-shrink" and "flex-basis" specified with their default values.</li>
            <li><strong>Here is the code for this example:</strong></li>
            <li><img src="./img/flex-grow-html.png"> <img src="./img/flex-grow-css.png"></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example output:</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="one-1"></div>
            <div class="two-1"></div>
            <div class="three-1"></div>
        </div>


        <!-- Flex-shrink -->
        <h3>Flex-shrink:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Shrink is the idea of shrinking the flex items if the items are greater than the parent container</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ex:</strong>if our 3 divs from above had a width declaration like: width: 100px, and .flex-container was smaller than 300px, our divs would have to shrink to fit.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The default shrink factor is 
            "flex-shrink: 1", which means all items will shrink evenly.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>f you do not want an item to shrink then you can specify flex-shrink: 0;</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>**</strong> You can also specify higher numbers to make certain items shrink at a higher rate than normal.</li>
            <li>An example would be more clear:</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="one-2"></div>
            <div class="two-2"></div>
            <div class="three-2"></div>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>Here's an example. Note that we've also changed the flex-basis for reasons that will be explained shortly. If you shrink your browser window you'll notice that ".two-2" never gets smaller than the given width of 250px (<em>since the flex-shrink is set to 0</em>), even though the flex-grow rule would otherwise specify that each element should be equally sized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>N.B.:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>**</strong>An important implication to notice here is that when you specify <u>flex-grow</u> or <u>flex-shrink</u>, flex items do not necessarily respect your given values for width.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the above example, all 3 divs are given a width of 250px, but when their parent is big enough, they grow to fill it.</li>
                    <li>Likewise, when the parent is too small, the default behavior is for them to shrink to fit. This is not a bug, but it could be confusing behavior if you aren't expecting it.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>



        <!-- Flex-Basis -->
        <h3>Flex-basis:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>flex-basis</strong> sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size.</li>
            <li>The shorthand value defaults to flex-basis: 0%.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the previous example, the reason we had to change it flex-basis to auto in the flex-shrink example is that with the <u>basis set to 0, those items would ignore the item's width</u>, and everything would shrink evenly.</li>
                <li>Using auto as a flex-basis tells the item to check for a width declaration (width: 250px).</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>N.B.,</strong><em>The actual default value for flex-basis is auto, but when you specify flex: 1 on an element => flex: 1 is equivilant to flex: 1 1 0.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- What is flex auto -->
        <h3>What is flex auto?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>flex: auto</strong> is one of the shorthands of flex (i.e., flex: auto == flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: auto == flex: 1 1 auto.</li>
        </ul>
