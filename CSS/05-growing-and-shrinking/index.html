        <!-- The flex shorthand -->
        <h2>The flex shorthand</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The "flex" declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can set on a flex item.</li>
            <li>These properties affect how flex items size themselves within their container.</li>
            <li><em>"Shorthand properties are CSS properties that let you set the values of multiple other CSS properties simultaneously."</em></li>
            <li>"flex" is shorthand for "flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis"</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ex:</strong>"flex: 1;" &#8801; "flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0"</li>
                <!--

        <!-- Flex-grow -->
        <h2>Flex-grow</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>flex-grow expects a <u>single number</u> as its value, and that number is used as the flex-item's “growth factor”.</li>
            <li>When we applied "flex: 1" to every div inside our container, we were telling every div to <u>grow the same amount</u>. The result of this is that every div ends up the exact same size.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If we instead add flex: 2 to just one of the divs, then that div would grow to 2x the size of the others.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
